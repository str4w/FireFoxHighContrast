#Invert Colors
This is forked from


https://github.com/Max-Github/FireFoxInvertColors

A simple FireFox add-on that injects CSS to invert most of the colors, but leave selected parts alone.  Special CSS for specific classes on flikr, and 
eventually other websites is included.

This is currently an experimental development to assist family members with difficulty seeing.
